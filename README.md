# Hi, I’m Ricardo Griffith 👋

<img width="2816" height="1536" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88466f0d-c195-45ae-a8f9-a1af923bc3e2" />


I’m a **Technical Architect and hands-on builder** with a strong foundation in modern .NET, cloud-native architecture, and pragmatic delivery. I enjoy designing systems that scale, mentoring teams, and staying close enough to the code to keep architecture honest.

My work lives at the intersection of **engineering execution and technical leadership**. I care about clean abstractions, resilient infrastructure, and building platforms that make other developers faster and safer.

Outside of work, you’ll still find me exploring games, experimenting with new tech, and hunting down a solid coffee and pastry ☕🍩

## What I Do

- Design and build **cloud-native applications** using modern .NET and AWS  
- Lead and mentor teams while remaining **deeply technical**
- Translate business needs into **secure, maintainable architectures**
- Modernize legacy systems without losing institutional knowledge
- Continuously learn. Continuously refine.

## Technical Focus

### Core Stack
- **.NET 10** (ASP.NET Core, Minimal APIs, Web APIs)
- **AWS-first architecture**: EC2, VPC, Route 53, RDS (PostgreSQL), SES, CloudWatch
- **Containerized workloads** with Docker
- API-first, infrastructure-aware design

### Programming Languages
C# (primary) | Python | JavaScript | Swift | Rust (actively developing foundations)  
<sub>Legacy & historical experience: VB.NET, VBA</sub>

### Cloud Platforms
**AWS (Primary)**  
App Runner, EC2, VPC, Route 53, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, WAF, Lambda, SES, EFS, CloudFront, IAM

**Microsoft Azure (Secondary)**  
Azure Functions, Azure Blob Storage, Azure AI Document Intelligence  
<sub>Used selectively where it best fits the problem</sub>

### Web & Application Technologies
ASP.NET Core | REST APIs | HTML | CSS | Bootstrap | NGINX | IIS  
<sub>Legacy exposure: ASP.NET Web Forms, early .NET Core versions</sub>

### Databases & Data
PostgreSQL | Microsoft SQL Server | SQLite | MySQL | AWS Aurora (PostgreSQL)  
SSMS | SSIS | Power BI | SQL performance tuning

### DevOps & Tooling
Docker | Git | GitHub | Bitbucket | Azure Repos  
Visual Studio | VS Code | Azure Data Studio  
CI/CD pipelines, environment-based configuration, secrets management

### Architecture & Delivery
Agile | Scrum | Waterfall (when appropriate)  
API design | System integration | Application modernization | Security-aware design

## AI-Assisted Development (Vibe Coding)

I actively use AI as a **force multiplier** in my development workflow, treating it as a collaborative coding partner rather than a replacement for engineering judgment.

- **OpenAI Codex** – rapid prototyping, refactoring, and exploratory coding
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** – command-line driven development assistance
- **Claude Code** – reasoning-heavy refactors, architecture exploration, and code review
- **Google Gemini CLI** – alternative model perspectives and comparative problem solving

I apply these tools thoughtfully to accelerate delivery while maintaining code quality, security, and architectural intent.

## On Learning & Growth

I believe strong architects never stop learning. Some areas I’m actively investing in:

- Deepening **cloud-native patterns** on AWS
- Writing safer, more explicit code with **Rust**
- Balancing leadership responsibilities with hands-on technical work
- Refining how teams communicate architecture and intent

Certifications and coursework reflect different stages of my journey. Some are historical, some are current, all contributed to how I think and build today.
